"""Audio capture and real-time root mean squared (RMS) calculation script
using a non-blocking implementation of PyAudio

- Don't forget to turn off active/auto noise cancellation on your recording device
- If you have an external microphone make use of that
- Please bring headphones to the lecture

Script will prompt for entry of the device number for audio input you'd like to use.
If entry is invalid, script will default to device '-1', which uses the system default device.

Usage:
>python audio_record.py

Requirements:
PyAudio: https://people.csail.mit.edu/hubert/pyaudio/

How to install:

Windows
>python -m pip install pyaudio

OSX
>brew install portaudio
>pip install pyaudio

Linux
>sudo apt-get install python-pyaudio python3-pyaudio
